## Data Prep

### Data Cleansing 

The first step, preprocessing, is mainly cleaning the data by removing any unnecessary and irrelevant words. To clean the data,
- Removed contractions (e.g. can’t to can not).
- Converted all words to lowercase
- Removed numbers, usernames, and IP addresses.
- Removed stop words (e.g. “and”, “or”, “the”, “that”, etc.)
